# Weather-Site
Simple weather site project to work on AJAX request to a weather api
This is a site that was a assignment in client server-side scripting class
The object of the assignment was to do a ajax request to a weather api (https://openweathermap.org/api) and recieve back json data
I could only use vanilla JavaScript, no jQuery
